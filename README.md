# OxidationAndHighTempAnalysisOnInterMetallicXGaNanocrystals
Collection of Scripts and Material Data used in the Master's Thesis by Jean-Marc Sujata with the title "Oxidation and High-Temperature Analysis on novel, inter-metallic X-Ga (X=Ag, Au, Cu) Nanocrystals

# Installation
Download all the files and use requirements.txt to install the necessary packages.
For the command line, use "pip install -r requirements.txt"
IDE such as PyCharm (recommended) automatically detect requirements.txt

# Run
All the the material parameters and variable parameters from the differential equation are given in the params.json file.

The functions in the file DiffusionModel are commented. 
Per default, the main.py function runs the DiffusionModel.combined_model_plot().
